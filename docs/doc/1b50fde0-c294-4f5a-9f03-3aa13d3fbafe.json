    "summary": "This code defines the TCEffect class, which is used to record the efficiency of Demand solutions. It provides two methods, rEffect and hEffect, which take a TOFoModel as a parameter. These methods are likely called when creating Demand tasks or evaluating their effectiveness over time. The resulting effectiveness data is stored in the effectDic of the task's source fos.",
