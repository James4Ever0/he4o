    "summary": "This code defines a class named AIShortMatchModel_Simple, which is a short-term memory model for AI. It has properties for an algorithm pointer (alg_p), input time (in seconds), and a Boolean flag to indicate if it's a timestamp. The class also provides a method called newWithAlg_p:inputTime:isTimestamp: to initialize the instance of this class.",
