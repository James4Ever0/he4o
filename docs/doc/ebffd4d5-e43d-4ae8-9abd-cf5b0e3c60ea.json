    "summary": "This code defines the AIVisionAlgs class, which contains vision algorithms for a virtual scene rather than real camera input. The class has properties such as size, color, shape, position, and speed. It also includes a method commitView that takes two UIViews and a rect as parameters to perform some action related to vision algorithms.",
