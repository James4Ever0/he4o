    "summary": "This code describes a sensory algorithm that can be accessed via API. It converts input single frames of image and audio into models, using a sparse coding unit. The model is a three-dimensional array with layers representing sparse codes, regional codes (for learning features), and concurrent codes (for learning concepts). Currently, only two-dimensional arrays are supported due to the simplicity of virtual scenes in V2. The author plans to extend support for three-dimensional arrays in future versions.",
